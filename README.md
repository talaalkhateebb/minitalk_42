Description:
Minitalk is a small client-server communication program developed in C, using UNIX signals only.  
The goal of this project is to send a string from a client process to a server process, bit by bit, using `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`.

This project is part of the 42 curriculum and focuses on:
- Inter-process communication
- Signal handling
- Bitwise operations
- Low-level system programming

Technologies
- Language: C
- Signals: `SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`
- System calls: `signal`, `sigaction`, `kill`, `getpid`, `pause`, `usleep`, `malloc`, `free`

Compilation
Compile the project using:
```bash
make

Usage
- Start the server
./server

The server will display its PID:

Server PID: 12345

- Send a message from the client
./client <PID> "Your message here"


Example:

./client 12345 "Hello Minitalk!"


The server will immediately display:

Hello Minitalk!

**Mandatory Features

-Server prints its PID on launch

-Client sends a string to the server

-Communication uses only UNIX signals

-Only SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are used

-Server can receive multiple messages without restarting

-No memory leaks

-No unexpected crashes (segfaults, double free, etc.)

** Bonus Features

-Server sends an acknowledgment signal to the client after receiving a message

-Unicode (UTF-8) character support 👻

** Implementation Details

-Each character is sent bit by bit

-SIGUSR1 represents 0

-SIGUSR2 represents 1

-The server reconstructs characters after receiving 8 bits

-Signal handling is done using sigaction

** Testing & AI Usage

AI tools were used to help  brainstorm test cases for this project.
All test cases were reviewed, executed manually, and fully understood.

No AI-generated code was copied into the project.
All implementation, logic, and debugging were done by the author.

** Testing

You can test multiple clients by running:

./client <PID> "First message"
./client <PID> "Second message"


The server should correctly display both messages sequentially.

** Notes

-Linux does not queue signals, so timing (usleep) is important

-One global variable per program is used and justified

-Project follows 42 Norm
